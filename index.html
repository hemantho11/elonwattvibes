                    Elon Musk, the genius CEO behind solar power giant Tesla has been the talk of the town lately.

                </p>

                <p>He goes on to say <b>"The big power companies are scamming you.</b> Yes, that's right. Believe it or not, they have been using a secret to cheat you every time you run your lights, dishwasher, blender, vacuum and anything else that draws
                    power. This is why your power bill is so expensive every month and keeps rising with some

						daughter came to check up on her after many unanswered phone calls and tragically found
						Dorothy lifeless on the couch with her husband. </b>

                <p>"The heat just got her. She had no power, no air conditioning, can you imagine? She was very prideful and ashamed to ask for help.
                    <b>No one knew she fell behind and couldn't afford to pay for the high electric bills
						anymore.</b> She was always a very active person, always around the house, nothing could stop her."

                    <b>Dorothy was such a kind soul and integral to the team's success. She worked so hard and was

                <h2>The Perfect Storm For Innovation...</h2>


                <p>Seeing just how devastating electricity prices are on the average American's wallet, and witnessing his own employee, Dorothy Smith pass away tragically, Elon Musk set out to find his old drawing plans for an <b>electricity saver invention</b>                    he had made as a young genius in South Africa. The original drawing was based on a concept by his idol, legendary inventor, electrical and mechanical engineer and visionary, <b>Nikola Tesla.</b>
                </p>

                <p>After a few hours of digging through old papers, he found it! Elon immediately called one of his brightest engineers at Tesla and trusted friend, Ed Sherwood. Combining their expertise, they set out to bring Elon's <b>electricity saving dream</b>                    to life.</p>





                <p>After a few weeks of work in a back room of the Tesla factory, they had a finished project. It was a source of happiness after so many weeks of sorrow mourning the death at the Tesla factory.

                <p>Combining their experience they came up with a ground-breaking device
                    <b>that helps you not only lower your electric bill, but can also increase the lifespan on

                <h2>How Do Power Companies Scam the Public? How Does the Stop Watt Work?</h2>

                <p>Stop Watt is a small, compact, affordable, and
                    <b>easy-to-use plug-in device that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables
						in your home and lowers your consumption instantly.</b> You just plug it in and let this smart device work it's magic. It's easy to connect, simply plug into the outlet closest to your breaker box. That is all you need to do,
                    once plugged in the green LED indicates it is powered on and working.
                </p>

                <p>The fact is, all appliances draw more power than they need to run, due to inefficiencies and noise on the sine wave created by the electric companies to overcharge customers and scam them.
                    <b>Power companies take advantage of this situation, and overcharge their customers for it. Due
						to their monopoly, the government is unwilling to step in and address this situation.</b>
                </p>

                <p>The Stop Watt reduces this noise, thereby decreasing the amount of electricity used. So none is wasted.
                    <b>It doesn’t change the meter reading, or steal power from anywhere else, it simply uses the
						energy more efficiently, so less is needed.</b>
                </p>
                <p>Within just 24 hours, it makes more efficient use of the total energy draw resulting in energy savings.
                    <b>Your next power bill should be signifigantly lower as it becomes accustomed to the energy use
						in your home and stops excess electricity from enterting the electric cables.</b>
                </p>

                </div>
                <p><b>"Stop Watt is your power company's worst nightmare" says Elon.</b> They have been trying to hide Stop Watt from the everyday consumer and have banned it in retail shops leaving it to be sold online only. Big Energy is threatened by
                    this device and its potential to cut into profits.
                </p>

                <p>And something else few people are aware of is that utility companies overload circuits, which in turn shortens the lifespan of appliances.
                    <b>The Stop Watt helps household appliance by boosting their life-cycle.</b> Which means the Stop Watt will quickly pay for itself.
                </p>

                <p>Power companies are spending millions of dollars lobbying the government to keep it off store shelves. Because they know it will eat deep into their massive profits, so they are fighting tooth and nail to keep it out of homeowner’s hands.
                    It has become Elon's mission to make sure it enters every American's hands.

                <h2>Putting Stop Watt to the Test...</h2>

                <p>After Elon got his hands on the first prototype produced, he distibuted them for free to a private test group tasked with putting the Stop Watt to the test and sharing their results online.
                </p>

                <p>Another tester by the name of David Sansbury wrote in with his review:

						$120! And it’s only gotten better from there… We’ll be customers for life."</b>
                </p>


                <p>With Elon Musk's dream realized and his invention working perfectly, it was time to do some real good. They finalized plans to set up manufacturing through a new Tesla backed start-up he created for Stop Watt. In 2 weeks they had the first
                    100 consumer models, and set up a plan to scale up production and
                    <b>get a Stop Watt to everyone in the U.S. that wants or needs one by Fall 2022</b>.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p><b>Yes, the Stop Watt is 100% legal to use.</b> There is no risk in using this amazing, electricity-saving device. Of course, power companies are not happy that people are using it, and reducing their profits. But there’s nothing they
                    can do except try their best to keep the Stop Watt out of as many homes as they can.</p>
                <p>Considering the cost savings this device can offer, many people expect it to be a big investment. However, that is not the case.
                    <b>In a country wide effort to expand the awareness of Stop Watt, they are offering our
						readers a limited time EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT.</b>
                </p>

                <p>However, due to so much recent media attention and increased pressure from Big Electric, these money-saving tools may become impossible to find soon. And because power companies have been trying to hide the Stop Watt from the public, many
                    have been banned in retail shops. However, thanks to the Internet, the word is out and growing in awareness and use among everyday people. And they are being rewarded with far less power consumption, and longer-running household appliances
                    because of all the energy it conserves.</p>


                <h2>What Does Elon Musk's Invention Mean for All of Us? </h2>

                    too due to everything he learned streamlining manufacturing for Tesla.


                </p>
                <p>He has now launched a

                    <b>everyone that wants to fight the electric companies and lower their electricity bill by up to
						90% is able to.</b> But you should act now since <u>after Black Friday they announced they could run out any time

                </p>
